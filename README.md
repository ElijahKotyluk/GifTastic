# GifTastic

I am using the GIPHY API to build a GIF search application. The theme will be Final Fantasy, search for your favorite characters from any and all of the games. 

# Getting Starting
- Clone this repo locally
- Open the 'index.html' file with your default browser
- Enter in any character or anime name and watch the GIFs fly!
